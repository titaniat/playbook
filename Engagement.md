#Engagement

Something difficult at Yale is getting people to maintain commitment to a job, especially one as time-intensive as this.
People tend to commit tentatively, but taper off as outside projects, homework, etc. come up. 
If they feel like the job is neither meaningful nor enjoyable, they will quit.

So how do we maintain a group of students willing to do the work we ask of them? We try to lay out our principles and abide
by them; we hold them accountable for the work they are and are not doing (in a thoughtful and understanding manner); and we
try to make the literal and figurative SDMP space as fun and inviting as possible.

##Principles
###Mission Statement  
At the Student Developer Mentorship Program, we strive to build elegant and functional software
 in a professional, collaborative environment while having fun!!!


###Teamwork
SDMP employees are hired in teams and work in teams, from discussing ideas with their whole team to
working in pairs and reviewing code. But being a team player means doing work independently,
making sure team members are working on assigned projects on their own time.
We ask that everyone puts in at least 8 hours of work, both in scheduled shifts and on their own time,
and that their time is documented well.


###Communication and Honesty
We expect that employees will communicate with us as soon as possible and as honestly as possible
about any issues they have, from being stuck on a section of code to last-minute problem set emergencies.
We’ve all been students. We’re all humans (except for Lec, ha). We understand.
We clearly communicate to our employees our expectations, and we ask them to be honest with us
about their abilities and limitations.


###Flexibility
We practice agile software development, which is a highly flexible and adaptable system of development.
We adapt our software plans on the fly based on feedback and necessity.
And just as we’re flexible in our development, we are also flexible in our organization -
while we have scheduled shifts and working spaces, we adapt our practices based on feedback from students and customers,
and we’re always improving.

In return, we ask from our employees flexibility and understanding - sometimes, things take much longer
or need more work than expected, and even though we’re all busy Yale students,
we also have made a commitment to the program and to our customers.


###Understanding
This is a learning experience for us, and as such, we’re going to make mistakes. We understand that.
Constructive criticism helps everyone grow, in all directions.
If our employees mess up, we understand and look for ways to move past it together.
If we mess up, we want to be held accountable so we can improve.


###Seriousness
We don’t take ourselves too seriously here - we steal bears, we draw dinosaurs on whiteboards,
we buy too many Hot Cheetos. But we do take our work seriously.
We don’t have too many egos here, but we do have people who are dedicated to their work
and to producing the best product possible.


###Growth Mindset
SDMP is ultimately a place where students come to develop their skills as software engineers
and learn how programming works in the real world. We don’t take the “Mentorship” part lightly -
we use real, professional programming flows and techniques, and are focused on helping students grow.
We want our students to be able to access whatever resources this university offers, and in turn,
pass that valuable learning down to the people they end up mentoring, either in a formal (team leads)
or informal (senior coworker) capacity. We hope to have a fund with which students can apply for tools
to expand their learning in the future.
