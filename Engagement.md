#Engagement

Something difficult at Yale is getting people to maintain commitment to a job, especially one as time-intensive as this. People tend to commit tentatively, but taper off as outside projects, homework, etc. come up. If they feel like the job is neither meaningful nor enjoyable, they will quit.

So how do we maintain a group of students willing to do the work we ask of them? We try to lay out our principles and abide by them; we hold them accountable for the work they are and are not doing (in a thoughtful and understanding manner); and we try to make the literal and figurative SDMP space as fun and inviting as possible.

##Principles
###Mission Statement  
At the Student Developer Mentorship Program, we strive to build elegant and functional software in a professional, collaborative environment while having fun!!!


###Teamwork
SDMP employees are hired in teams and work in teams, from discussing ideas with their whole team to working in pairs and reviewing code. But being a team player means doing work independently, making sure team members are working on assigned projects on their own time. We ask that everyone puts in at least 8 hours of work, both in scheduled shifts and on their own time, and that their time is documented well.


###Communication and Honesty
We expect that employees will communicate with us as soon as possible and as honestly as possible about any issues they have, from being stuck on a section of code to last-minute problem set emergencies. We’ve all been students. We’re all humans (except for Lec, ha). We understand. We clearly communicate to our employees our expectations, and we ask them to be honest with us about their abilities and limitations.


###Flexibility
We practice agile software development, which is a highly flexible and adaptable system of development. We adapt our software plans on the fly based on feedback and necessity. And just as we’re flexible in our development, we are also flexible in our organization - while we have scheduled shifts and working spaces, we adapt our practices based on feedback from students and customers, and we’re always improving.

In return, we ask from our employees flexibility and understanding - sometimes, things take much longer or need more work than expected, and even though we’re all busy Yale students, we also have made a commitment to the program and to our customers.


###Understanding
This is a learning experience for us, and as such, we’re going to make mistakes. We understand that. Constructive criticism helps everyone grow, in all directions. If our employees mess up, we understand and look for ways to move past it together. If we mess up, we want to be held accountable so we can improve.


###Seriousness
We don’t take ourselves too seriously here - we steal bears, we draw dinosaurs on whiteboards, we buy too many Hot Cheetos. But we do take our work seriously. We don’t have too many egos here, but we do have people who are dedicated to their work and to producing the best product possible.


###Growth Mindset
SDMP is ultimately a place where students come to develop their skills as software engineers and learn how programming works in the real world. We don’t take the “Mentorship” part lightly - we use real, professional programming flows and techniques, and are focused on helping students grow. We want our students to be able to access whatever resources this university offers, and in turn, pass that valuable learning down to the people they end up mentoring, either in a formal (team leads) or informal (senior coworker) capacity. We hope to have a fund with which students can apply for tools to expand their learning in the future.


##Tracking
We use [Shifts](http://shifts.yale.edu/stcdev), a program built by Yale students, to track hours and attendance. It's very buggy (to say the least), but it allows us to see who's working and when, update payforms automatically, and generally keep track of hours.

We try to use a combination of scheduled shifts and unscheduled shifts to do work. Another thing we've noticed about Yale students is that unless work fits in their calendar as a repeating event, people will simply not make the time for it - it gets drowned out by all the other things that Yale students are and can be busy with. We are flexible from week to week about hours worked; we just need students to communicate with us about their needs.

We communicate through [Slack](http://slack.com), with various channels for each team as well as for each project. Team leads are generally in charge of getting their teams together to meet, but anyone can message most of the channels. If someone is late or doesn't make a shift, generally their team lead will message them, although we don't have a formalized system for this yet.

##Perks
We try to model our culture as closely as we can with a limited budget against successful companies. We have a dedicated space, 143 Elm St., in the basement to do our work. We provide snacks for free (lots of snacks!!!), have whiteboard walls to promote creativity and fun, supply moveable tables to promote flexibility, and hold fun events, like board game and movie nights, trips to Escape New Haven and apple picking. On days where multiple people can make it to the same shift - which we especially like, since we prefer teams to pair program and work together - we buy inexpensive but special snacks, such as bagels or ice cream. 

We also have speakers, a gigantic bear that we've stolen from our sister program (the Student Technology Collaborative), and two big TVs. In short, we make our work space a fun place to be and to work!
