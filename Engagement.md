#Engagement

Something difficult at Yale is getting people to maintain commitment to a job, especially one as time-intensive as this.
People tend to commit tentatively, but taper off as outside projects, homework, etc. come up. 
If they feel like the job is neither meaningful nor enjoyable, they will quit.

So how do we maintain a group of students willing to do the work we ask of them? We try to lay out our principles and abide
by them; we hold them accountable for the work they are and are not doing (in a thoughtful and understanding manner); and we
try to make the literal and figurative SDMP space as fun and inviting as possible.
