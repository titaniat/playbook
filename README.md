# Yale SDMP Playbook [v0.1]

## Introduction

This document is the canonical source for how the Yale Student Developer and Mentorship Program (SDMP) operates. It is inspired by the [Thoughtbot Playbook](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook) and describes how we build software using teams of students, training them on the practice of software development in _professional and collaborative environments_. It is based on years of experience, but at the same time is a work-in-progress as we continue to iterate and improve on our processes. As such, we maintain it as a living document that all SDMP participants can edit in a private GitLab repo.

We've made this playbook free under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license so that other student developer programs can learn from and/or use our approach at their own institutions or organizations. Please bear in mind that this is currently evolving so use your judgement when implementing any of the techniques outlined here.
